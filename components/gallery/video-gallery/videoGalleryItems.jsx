            description: "In 2020, we started studying glaciers in the Maulino Andes and found severe retreat, with one glacier losing up to 16 meters in height in a year.Glaciers regulate water flow, crucial during droughts and summer. Their loss threatens our water supply. A UNESCO Global Geopark will promote sustainable living, raising awareness about future water resources and encouraging preparation."
