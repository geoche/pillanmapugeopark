            question: "why collaborative work?",
            answer: "Given the problems we are currently facing, the need to join forces and align the efforts of the different actors is imperative. The Maule region is no exception. The rainfall deficit increases every year and wild spaces are steadily losing ground. From this point of view, collaborative models are more important than ever. From the Pillanmapu Geopark we are taking a step towards collaborative work by creating the Network of Friends of the Geopark."
