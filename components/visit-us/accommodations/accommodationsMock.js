        description: "We are located in the heart of the Villuercas-Ibores-Jara Geopark, in a privileged environment, surrounded by majestic vegetation, with a multitude of paths and routes where you can connect with nature, away from noise and rush, here time is marked by your steps, your desire to immerse yourself and get to know our town and its surroundings, traveling through history and being surprised by the great importance of Guadalupe in the world."
            + "We have brochures about Guadalupe and its surroundings. The local tour guides are knowledgeable and passionate about our customs and history, which will surely surprise you!! (Guide service not included in the reservation price)"
            + "The Rincón de la Pernila is named after the place where the farm and house are located. The farm has 1,8 hectares or 18,000 square meters, so that you can enjoy nature and meet our animals, who help us maintain the vegetation and the environment. From our viewing point you will enjoy fantastic views of Guadalupe."
            + "We are immersed in nature, our main source of energy is solar energy, clean and environmentally friendly energy, that is why we ask you to use electricity as rationally as possible, avoiding the connection of several appliances at the same time, or the use of air conditioning with caution, the needs are covered with solar energy but if necessary we have a diesel generator that will come into operation when necessary either due to the weather or due to excess consumption at odd \"solar\" hours. Although our wish is that it does not start up, both starting and stopping are automatic, do not worry, it is somewhat noisy ... especially if you are used to the silence that surrounds you.",
