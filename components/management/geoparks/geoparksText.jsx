        "Collaborative work is part of the spirit of UNESCO Global Geoparks. For this reason, in mid-2020, the Geoparks of Chile group was formed, which integrates the different Geopark projects that exist in Chile. These are, from north to south: Atacama Geopark Project, Petorca Valley Geopark Project, Puchuncaví Geopark Project, Cajón del Maipo Geopark Project, Pillanmapu Geopark Project, Biobío Coastal Mining Geopark Project and, finally, the only UNESCO-certified Geopark in Chile, the Kütralkura UNESCO Global Geopark."
