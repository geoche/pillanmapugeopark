              "answer": "No. A Geopark is a figure recognized by UNESCO while National Parks and Reserves are figures recognized by the State of Chile. There are also substantial differences in terms of management. Parks and reserves are closed areas, where a conservation model is proposed in which the only economic activity permitted is tourism. In contrast, UNESCO Global Geoparks are large, inhabited territories where different activities take place. Geoparks apply a participatory management and conservation strategy, which involves local communities in the process, generating a redefinition of the territory, which consequently brings care and respect for the environment."
            },
            "question2": {
              "question": "Are Geoparks legally recognized in Chile as conservation figures?",
              "answer": "No. Geoparks are not legislative designations. The conservation strategy employed by a Geopark is different from that employed in National Parks/Reserves, which are under the protection of Chilean law. A Geopark seeks to generate a redefinition of the territory by local communities. To do this, it is essential to value the natural and cultural heritage through education. Through this process, local communities understand that they can live with and from the territory, making sustainable use of heritage elements."
            },
            "question3": {
              "question": "Is there an entrance fee to the Geopark/do you have to pay to enter the Geopark?",
              "answer": "No. Unlike a park or reserve, Geoparks do not have an entrance fee. Geoparks usually cover large portions of territory so it is possible to enter them from different points."
            },
            "question4": {
              "question": "Does the existence of a UNESCO Global Geopark prevent extractive activities such as mining?",
              "answer": "Geoparks usually cover areas much larger than those occupied by national parks or reserves. Therefore, within a Geopark it is common to find extractive activities, as well as towns, roads and even other conservation measures. A Geopark is a territorial management model that, unlike parks or reserves, does not suppress all extractive activity, but rather works with different actors to safeguard the care of heritage sites and establish management plans that have the least possible impact."
            },
            "question5": {
              "question": "Are there other Geopark projects in Chile?",
              "answer": "Yes. There are several Geopark projects in Chile. However, obtaining UNESCO certification requires hard work and a series of requirements must be met before considering applying. Currently, in Chile there is only one Geopark admitted within the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network: the Kütralkura Geopark, located in Araucanía. The Pillanmapu Geopark team is working tirelessly to apply to UNESCO as soon as possible and thus take an important step towards managing the heritage of the Maule Andes."

It includes significant geosites, such as the Teno Lakes or the Planchón Volcano. Along this route, you will find the oldest rocks in the Geopark, dating back 175 million years, which reveal a time when Chile was very different from today: the Andes Mountains did not exist, and much of Chile was submerged under the sea.",
            "par2": "The lower part of the route is ideal for hiking, wildlife observation, or swimming in natural pools, while the higher areas offer opportunities for activities like ski mountaineering, ice climbing, mountaineering, or kayaking. For all these activities, we recommend hiring a qualified guide and maintaining a respectful attitude toward the environment.",
            "par3": "You can access the entire georoute through public roads, most of which are suitable for all types of transport. However, those wishing to reach the Teno Lakes or the Planchón Volcano must take a dirt road that is impassable during winter and requires vehicles with traction."

However, this route rewards those who venture on it with spectacular landscapes and trails through native forests dominated by species of the Nothofagus genus, typical of southern Chile.
